/**
 * Lifecycle of a type 113 (0x71) transaction
 * msg.sender is the bootloader system contract
 *
 * Phase 1 Validation
 * 1. The user sends the transaction to the "zkSync API client" (sort of a "light node")
 * 2. The zkSync API client checks to see the nonce is unique by querying the NonceHolder system contract
 * 3. The zkSync API client calls validateTransaction, which MUST update the nonce
 * 4. The zkSync API client checks the nonce is updated
 * 5. The zkSync API client calls payForTransaction, or prepareForPaymaster & validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction
 * 6. The zkSync API client verifies that the bootloader gets paid
 *
 * Phase 2 Execution
 * 7. The zkSync API client passes the validated transaction to the main node / sequencer (as of today, they are the same)
 * 8. The main node calls executeTransaction
 * 9. If a paymaster was used, the postTransaction is called
